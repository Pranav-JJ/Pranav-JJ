## Hello there! ðŸ‘‹
<br/>
I'm Pranav Joshi, a passionate Computer Engineering undergraduate at VIT Pune. I love exploring new tools and technologies that fascinate me. I am always on the lookout for new learning opportunities and enjoy coming up with new projects to work on.

My primary interests lie in the fields of **Artificial Intelligence** and **Machine Learning**, particularly the fields of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Generative AI**.
